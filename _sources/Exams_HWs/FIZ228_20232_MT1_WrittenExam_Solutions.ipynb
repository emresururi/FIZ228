If you want them to calculate the error, you need to specify what you mean by “the error” (the formula); if you want them to fit the data, you need to specify what you mean by “fitting the data”, how it is done, on what criteria.

    "1. Define an error function – the many candidate error functions, let’s pick the root means squares, i.e. $\\operatorname{errf}(y,e) = \\sqrt{\\sum_i{(y_i-e_i)^2}}$. (Here, $y$ indicates the given data values and $e$ indicates the estimated values obtained using the tried parameter set.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Derive the optimized parameters by minimizing the error function. This will yield $\\text{params}_1$ and $\\text{params}_2$ parameter sets. Meaningful starting positions obtained by considering the given data and the candidate function's form will be most beneficial (e.g., if we are fitting a Gaussian, the position of the peak might be taken as $\\mu_0$ and the spread value can be used to define $\\sigma_0$; or if the fitting function is a sinusoidal, we can check the value range to come up with $A_0$ (and the shift along the y axis) and we can roughly estimate the period, hence deriving $\\omega_0$, etc.). To further refine the process, the boundaries for the parameters can also be specified considering the data at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Check if the parameters yield meaningful results (e.g., for a Gaussian function, $\\sigma$ can not be negative; for a sinusoidal function, the frequency can not be negative; like [the case we did in the class](../FIZ228_04_Regression.html#really-which-one-is-better), if we know that the given data is $v$ vs. $F_{\\text{drag}}$, the force can not take negative values for small values of $v$, etc.) \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Pick the function that has the minimum error given that its obtained parameters satisfy the 3rd criterion."
