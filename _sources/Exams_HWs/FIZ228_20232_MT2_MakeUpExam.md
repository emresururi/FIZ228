A given number of 4-dimensional data has been clustered into 5 class via k-means clustering 20 times and, along with the data points, the association of the points per each run has been collected in the {download}`FIZ228_20232_MT2_MakeUp_data_df_assignments.csv<../data/FIZ228_20232_MT2_MakeUp_data_df_assignments.csv>` file.

The final positions of the means in each run have also been stored in the {download}`FIZ228_20232_MT2_MakeUp_data_means_all.csv<../data/FIZ228_20232_MT2_MakeUp_data_means_all.csv>` file.

Derive the most optimal, overall mean positions using these data and explaining your approach and procedures.

**Bonus:** Calculate the sum of the square of the distances between the means and their associated points.
