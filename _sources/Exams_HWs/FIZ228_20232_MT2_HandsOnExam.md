# Midterm Exam #2 - Hands On Session
**FIZ228 - Numerical Analysis**  
Dr. Emre S. Tasci, Hacettepe University

17/05/2024

+++

Classify the 4-dimensional data of 120 points listed in the "FIZ228_20232_MT2_HandsOnExam_data.csv" file via k-means clustering method into 5 classes.

Output should contain:

* The association of each point into their corresponding mean
* Position of the means

Zip your .ipynb file as "FIZ228_20232_MT2_YourName.zip"(*) (don't use Turkish characters as it may result in error!) and upload it to hadi.


(*) this time you don't need to produce an html version (it's a little bit complicated via colab), only the ipynb file is sufficient -- we are actually archiving it because hadi doesn't accept ipynb files.
