    "Numerical analysis deals with all kinds of data: be it experimental results, surveys, collected values, etc. Almost all the time these data are too numerous to be entered or transferred via manual means so, different standards for file formats have been developed for different purposes. Even though every format can include specific notation and data format, most of the programs and applications are compatible with the most basic format of all: the comma-separated-values (CSV) format.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this format, different measurements / sets of data are stored in rows and for each set, different types are seperated via the comma (or tab or space). Although not standard, definition or extra information can be present at the start and it is usually the case that the row labels are also included most of the time for clarification. In this sense, one can visualize a spreadsheet (like those in MS Excel, LibreOffice Calc or Google Sheets) as a one-to-one representation of a CSV file.\n",
